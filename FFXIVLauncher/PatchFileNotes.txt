Very very incomplete notes, the ramblings of an insane girl who wants to make her own patcher for some godsforsaken reason

# Patch file

# HIST Entry

# APLY Entry
Entry length : 4 bytes (big endian)
Signature : 4 bytes "APLY"
??? : 4 bytes (big endian)
Entry data : [Entry length] bytes

# SQPK Entry
Container length : 4 bytes (big endian)
Signature : 4 bytes "SQPK"
Container length : 4 bytes (big endian) (yes it seems to be duplicated; data integrity reasons?)
Container data : [Container length] bytes

All containers seem to start with a 2 byte magic marker that determines
what kind of data is stored in there.

Types:
- "T" (TBD)
- "X" (TBD)
- "FA" (Raw file record?)

# Raw file record?

Type marker? : 2 bytes "FA"
??? : 14 bytes (usually all 0 but not always? has nothing to do with padding len)
Output file len : 4 bytes (big endian)
File name len : 4 bytes (big endian)
??? : 4 bytes (always 0?)
File name : [File name len] bytes
??? : 4 bytes (little endian?) (appears to always be 0x10)
??? : 4 bytes (always 0?)
Data len 1 : 4 bytes (little endian) (is the array len if compressed, ??? when uncompressed)
Data len 2 : 4 bytes (little endian) (output length, and array len if compressed)
Patch data : [File data len] bytes
Padding : ??????? bytes (whyyyyy)
